        <p><span>Dear <mark>[Company]</mark> Hiring Team,</span></p>

        <p>I am excited to apply for the <mark>[placeholder] Infrastructure Engineer</mark> position at <mark>[Company]</mark>.
           With extensive experience in <strong>cloud operations</strong>, <strong>incident response</strong>,
           and <strong>global infrastructure monitoring</strong>, I am eager to grow as an SRE and deepen my skills in automation and cloud architecture.</p>

        <p>In my previous role at Edgio, a global CDN, I supported enterprise customers by troubleshooting issues related to DNS, TLS, HTTP errors, 
           as well as DDoS mitigation.
           I worked extensively in Linux using tools such as <strong>a proprietary custom CLI, curl, dig, traceroute, and mtr</strong> for diagnostics,
           and platforms like <strong>Grafana</strong> and <strong>Cacti</strong> for performance analysis.
           I also contributed to automation with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong> and wrote internal documentation
           for CDN rule deployments, caching configurations, and network traffic analysis.</p>

        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Network Engineering and Security at WGU with a focus on AWS and DevOps.
           I hold the certifications of <strong>Network+</strong>, <strong>Security+</strong>, <strong>Linux+</strong>, <strong>ITIL 4</strong>, and <strong>AZ-900</strong>.</p>

        <p>What draws me to <mark>[Company]</mark> is your growth-oriented approach to infrastructure.
           I am especially excited about working with <strong>CI/CD</strong>, observability tools, and
           Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in a team that values learning, transparency, and continuous improvement.
           I am passionate about solving problems that matter and building reliable systems that scale.</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your mission and learn from
           the talented engineers at <mark>[Company]</mark>.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,<br>
